PCPartPicker Build Generator
----

End Goal: Build a reddit bot that interprets a comment with a 'price' parameter and tries to build various computers that might suit the needs of whoever called the bot.

Discussion Topics:

* [How do we prioritize what parts get what money?](https://github.com/JewsOfHazard/pcpartpicker-build-generator/issues/2)
* Is there a better way to interact with PCPP than urllib
* How much of PCPP's parameters should we implement (color all that needed?)

I've also used this project to play around with travis-ci a bit...
